### Regular Events Schedule

---

The maths department are running a number of **training sessions for the IMC (International Mathematics Competition)**, with the third session on **Wednesday (5th)**. These are open to everyone, including those who do not wish to try out for Warwick's team. For more information (including practise problems and their solutions from previous talks), see [this page](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/seminars/areas/imc/2024-25). The topic this week will be linear algebra, presented by the PhD student Jan Kus in **MS.03** from **1300** to **1400**.

*Note: this event is run & organised by the maths department and is not affiliated with the Society.*

---

Also on **Wednesday (5th)**, we will be running **Maths Café** in the **UG Workroom** as always, from **1400** to **1600**. As usual, we will be bringing some food for you to enjoy.

If you have any academic questions, our academic support officers (and many other attendees) will be happy to help. Also feel free to ask any questions about LaTeX.

Also on **Wednesday (5th)**, we will be running a **quiz night** in collaboration with the **Warwick Women’s Careers Society**, from **1600** to **1700** in **OC0.04**.

Also on **Wednesday (5th)**, we will be running a **circle** with the theme **fruit salad** from **1930** in the **[The Assembly, Leamington](https://assemblyleamington.com/)**.

---

On **Thursday (6th)**, we have our regularly scheduled **WMS Talk** titled *Patterns in Prime Numbers and the Riemann Hypothesis*, with guest PhD speaker Arshay Sheth, in **MS.04**, starting at **1800** until **1900**.

Abstract:
> The Riemann Hypothesis is often regarded as the greatest unsolved problem in mathematics, and is deeply connected with the patterns and distributions of prime numbers. In this talk, we will explore some of these patterns and explain the connection to the Riemann Hypothesis. We will also discuss various reasons why people believe the Riemann Hypothesis, what proving the Riemann Hypothesis would imply, and what approaches people have been tried so far to make progress on this problem.

As always, free pizza will be provided after the talk (suitable for all dietary requirements).

---

On **Friday (7th)**, we are running **Coffee and Cake**, our weekly welfare event, from **1500** to **1600**, in **MB0.07**. Drop in to get a free hot drink and some free food, and relax with others in an informal and friendly environment.
