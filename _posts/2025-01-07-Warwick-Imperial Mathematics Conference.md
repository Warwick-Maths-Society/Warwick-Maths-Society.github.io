We are now taking applications for speakers to present at the second Warwick-Imperial (WIMP) Mathematics Conference of 24/25!

We are looking for speakers to present **45 minute talks** on (**provisionally**) **Saturday, 1st March**, taking place in London at Imperial College London, to a large audience of fellow undergraduates from Imperial & Warwick! 

Prospective speakers should send their proposed title and abstract to [talks@warwickmaths.org](mailto:talks@warwickmaths.org)! 

This would be especially suitable to students who have done URSS or other research projects.

Speaker applications will close on **Friday 24th of January**!

Please note:
- Priority will be given to third year, fourth year, and MSc student speaker applicants, and that speaker slots are limited, so not all applications may be successful;
- Applications from joint degree students whose home department is not Mathematics are welcome;
- Applications from speakers who previously presented at the November round of WIMP will not be accepted to speak at the second round;
- As a society, we will be getting to London by coach, for which there will be a fee -- a registration of interest form will follow soon for all speakers and attendees concerning attendance and the coach;
- If you applied to the November round of WIMP and were unsuccessful but still want to apply to speak this term, reply to your previous application and your application from then will be reconsidered. You can also reply with a different talk application.
