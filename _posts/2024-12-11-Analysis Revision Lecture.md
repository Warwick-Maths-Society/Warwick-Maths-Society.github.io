The MA141 Analysis I revision lecture recording is available below:

This recording has been edited to remove minor typos/mistakes and extraneous tangents/pauses; some portions have also been slightly rearranged for improved flow; and some blackboard work has been reconstructed for improved visibility.

<br/>

The slides are available separately here:

### [Revision Lecture Slides](<../assets/talks/2024-2025/MA141 Analysis 1 - Revision Lecture.pdf>)

Some worked examples of continuity proofs may be found at the link below:

More resources may be added over the holiday depending on how much spare time Aris and I have (however, we both have our dissertations to work on, and I also have an upcoming exam, so don't count on this).
