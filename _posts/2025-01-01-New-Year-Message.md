# Happy new year from WMS!

As 2024 draws to a close, we hope you've had a restful winter break. Happy new year from all of us at Warwick Maths Society! We can't wait to see you all again in term 2.

### Mathematical Miscellany

2025 is a particularly exciting year for us mathematicians because it is a square number; the previous square year was 1936 and the next will be 2116. Here are a few other numerical facts about 2025:

- 2025 is the sum of two squares: \\(27^2+36^2\\);
- 2025 is the sum of *three* squares: \\(40^2+20^2+5^2\\);
- 2025 is the product of two squares: \\(9^2\times5^2\\), or three, if we allow \\(1^2\\);
- \\(2025=(20+25)^2\\);
- 2025 is the product of the proper divisors of its square root, \\(45\\): \\(2025=1\times3\times5\times9\times15\\);
- 2025 is the square of a triangular number (whose index is square!): \\(2025=T_9^2=T_{3^2}^2\\).
- \\(2025=\sum_{n=1}^{9}n^2=\left(\sum_{n=1}^{9}n\right)^2\\);
- The digital root of 2025 is also square: \\(2+0+2+5=9=3^2\\);
- 2025 is *powerful*, meaning that, if a prime \\(p\\) divides 2025, then \\(p^2\\) also divides 2025.
- 2024 and 2025 is the second time the year has been a tetrahedral number (2024) followed by a square number (2025);[^1] the next time will be 2600 and 2601.

[^1]: The last time this happened was year 120 and 121, but the modern calendar system wasn't invented until many centuries after.
