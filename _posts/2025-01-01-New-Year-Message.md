# Happy new year from WMS!

As 2024 draws to a close, we hope you've had a restful winter break. Happy new year from all of us at Warwick Maths Society! 2025 is a particularly exciting year for us mathematicians because it is a square number. The previous square year was 1936 and the next will be 2116. 

We can't wait to see you all again in term 2.
