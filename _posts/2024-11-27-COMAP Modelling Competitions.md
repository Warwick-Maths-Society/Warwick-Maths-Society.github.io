The *Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications*, (COMAP) are running the *Mathematical Contest in Modelling* (MCM) and the *Interdisciplinary Contest in Modelling* (ICM) competitions early next year. Registration at Warwick is organised by SIAM (PhD students in MathSys CDT), and supported by WMS.

The MCM and ICM are international contests for high school students and college undergraduates. The contests challenge teams of up to three students to analyze, model, solve, and present solution reports to an open-ended application problem. In these contests research, analytics, and applied intelligence are just as important as time management and problem selection.

## Format

Contest teams of up to three students address one of the following six problem choices over the period of the contest weekend.

- MCM Problem A (continuous)
- MCM Problem B (discrete)
- MCM Problem C (data insights)
- ICM Problem D (operations research/network science)
- ICM Problem E (sustainability)
- ICM Problem F (policy)

See [here](https://www.contest.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/matrix/index.html) for previous contest questions.


## Awards

The contests provide a challenge to solve a real-world application problem, and get recognition for it on an international stage. It's an excellent opportunity to develop your interpersonal skills through teamwork, develop technical writing and communication skills through your written report, feel a sense of accomplishment, and earn an impressive resume credential. Students and advisors report that participation and success in MCM/ICM provides an advantage when applying for internships and jobs.

MCM/ICM offer your team and school the chance to win prizes. The 2025 International COMAP Scholarship Award will be awarded to the six (6) top MCM/ICM teams from any of the participating countries/regions.

There are 20+ other prizes/certificates awarded by various other institutes and societies associated with the competition. See [here](https://www.contest.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/) for more details.
