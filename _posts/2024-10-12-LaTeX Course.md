In collaboration with UWCS, we are running an introductory workshop for the LaTeX typesetting system, aimed predominantly at first and second year CS and maths students (though all are welcome!). Learn how to harness the power of LaTeX to typeset your documents and write beautiful problem sheets, amazing reports, and more.

The first session will be on **Wednesday (16th)**, from **1700** to 1900. You are also welcome (and encouraged) to drop in to the weekly Maths Caf√© to practice typing up some LaTeX: our academic officers will be happy to help you.

This session will particularly help for those who have no experience with programming, but feel free to come along if you're already comfortable using LaTeX and want to ask for more advanced LaTeX help from our resident experts.

In this first session, we will be presenting a LaTeX quickstart guide using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), though you are welcome to ask about local installations if you so wish. Then, we will introduce basic LaTeX syntax, along with some standard packages and environments useful for typesetting maths and reports.
