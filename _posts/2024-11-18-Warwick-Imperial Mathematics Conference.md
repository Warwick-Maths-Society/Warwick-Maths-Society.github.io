Abstract:
> The Central Limit Theorem, which guarantees the appearance of the bell-shaped or normal curve, is one of the most fundamental principles in mathematics. It underlies much of statistics and is important in statistical mechanics, functional analysis and even number theory.
>
> In this talk I will explain why we have a right to expect this remarkable ubiquity by analogy with the second law of thermodynamics. I will also illustrate how the normal curve turns up in geometry and how this led to a proof that the analogy with thermodynamics does indeed make sense.

The conference is free to attend for Warwick students and you don't have to attend every talk - if you are interested in attending, it would be helpful if you could fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/z2i46uHCVH7PbdWP6) (to help us get an idea of attendance, audience makeup and for catering purposes)!
