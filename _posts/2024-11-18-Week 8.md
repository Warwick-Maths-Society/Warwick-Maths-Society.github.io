### Regular Events Schedule

On **Wednesday (20th)**, we will be running **Maths Café** in the **UG Workroom** as always, from **1300** to **1500**. As usual, we will be bringing some food for you to enjoy.

If you have any academic questions, our academic support officers (and many other attendees) will be happy to help. Also feel free to ask any questions about LaTeX.

On **Thursday (21st)**, we have our regularly scheduled **WMS Talk** titled *Characteristic Polynomials over Non-Commutative Rings*, with guest speaker Dr Emanuelle Dotto, in **MB0.08**, starting at **1800**. (Note the change in location from our usual room!)

Abstract:
> The characteristic polynomial of a matrix is one of the fundamental tools in linear algebra, especially because its roots are the eigenvalues of the matrix.
>
> In the first year, we typically introduce it for real or complex-valued matrices, but its definition makes sense over any commutative ring.
>
> This talk will give an overview of the characteristic polynomial, of its relationship with the trace via the logarithmic derivative, and explain how to extend its construction to non-commutative rings.

On **Thursday (21st)**, we are running **Coffee and Cake**, our weekly welfare event, from **1100** to **1200**, in **MB0.08**. Drop in to get a hot drink and some food, and relax with others in an informal and friendly environment.

On **Friday (22nd)**, *Optiver*, a global trading firm, are running a talk, *Trading Options: Predicting the future in more ways than one*, in **OC0.02 (the Oculus)** from **1200** to **1300** as part of the *Maths at Work* series.

Abstract:
> In the fast-paced world of trading, where exabytes of data and advanced mathematical models offer powerful insights, how do you harness these to anticipate market shifts and evolving prices? Numbers alone only tell part of the story. Beneath the surface lies the unpredictable force of human behavior—the delicate balance of buyers and sellers shaping the market’s course. In this talk, we’ll uncover how these forces intertwine, revealing insights that not only harness data but challenge conventional thinking about the future of trading.
