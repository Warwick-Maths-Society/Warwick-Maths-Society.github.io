Abstract:
> In this talk I will focus on my research on mathematical modelling to support the elimination of African sleeping sickness, a deadly, insect-borne disease. I’ll outline how my research in this area has evolved over the past 15 years, starting from my roots in more theoretical analysis of dynamical systems, through to calibration of models to real-world data via Bayesian statistics, using health economics to provide policy recommendations, and development of online tools to support ministries of health and other stakeholders. I will provide some personal perspectives on my academic journey , including challenges and highlights of my career so far.
