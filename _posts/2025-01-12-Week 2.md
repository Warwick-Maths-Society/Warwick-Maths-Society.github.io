### Regular Events Schedule

---

On **Monday (13th)**, we are running an Actuarial Careers Workshop in collaboration with the Warwick Actuarial Society and the Warwick Statistics Society titled *January Internship Insight & Corporate Awareness Briefing* from **1830** to **2000** in **FAB 2.43**. The session will cover:
- Current intership opportunities open this January;
- Practical CV advice to help you land internships;
- Key insights into the actuarial industry and economic trends to improve your corporate awareness for interviews.

The maths department are running a number of **training sessions for the IMC (International Mathematics Competition)**, starting from this **Wednesday (15th)**. These are open to everyone, including those who do not wish to try out for Warwick's team. For more information, see [this page](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/seminars/areas/imc/2024-25). The topic this week will be combinatorics, presented by Professor Oleg Pikhurko in **B1.01 (Zeeman)** from **1300** to **1400**.

*Note: this event is run & organised by the maths department and is not affiliated with the Society.*

Also on **Wednesday (15th)**, we will be running **Maths Café** in the **UG Workroom** as always, from **1400** to **1600**. As usual, we will be bringing some food for you to enjoy.

If you have any academic questions, our academic support officers (and many other attendees) will be happy to help. Also feel free to ask any questions about LaTeX.

--- 

Also on **Wednesday (15th)** and during Maths Café from **1400** to **1500** in the **UG Workroom**, there will be meet-up event for anyone on the mentorship scheme. This will be a great opportunity to chat with your group, socialise with WMS exec, and maybe even start asking about our society elections at the end of term. There will also be some interactive maths games. People not participating on the mentorship scheme are welcome to join.

Also on **Wednesday (15th)**, the Doctoral Training Centres in Mathematical and Computing Sciences (Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science and Modelling of Heterogeneous Systems) are running a **Research Careers Event**, aimed at students early in their undergraduate studies, from **1400** to **1600** in **MS.01**. The event will be comprised of two sessions. The first, *Introduction to Centres of Doctoral Training and funding opportunities*, running from **1400** to **1500**, will cover topics such as fellowships and funding, typical programme structure, research areas and requirements and pathways. The second, **Introduction to Centres of Doctoral Training and funding opportunities**, running from **1500** to **1600** will present an overview of summer research opportunities, both at Warwick (e.g. URSS) and elsewhere, followed by a chance to meet and chat to students that did a URSS project last summer.

If you are interested in attending either or both sessions, you should sign up [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/postgrad/research/wideningparticipationjan2025/registration) by **Monday (13th)**. For more information, see [this page](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/postgrad/wideningparticipationjan2025). 

*Note: this event is run & organised by the relevant departments and is not affiliated with the Society.*

On **Thursday (16th)**, we have our regularly scheduled **WMS Talk** titled *7 Card Dobble and the Klein Quartic*, with guest speaker Professor Helena Verrill, in **MS.04**, starting at **1800** until **1900**.

Abstract:
> The game Dobble is based on the projective plane over a finite field; for regular Dobble, we use the field with \\(7\\) elements, and get \\(57\\) cards.  For a simpler version, we take the field with \\(2\\) elements, and get a \\(7\\) card version of Dobble, "mini Dobble". To show how this relates to a plane, we can arrange the "mini Dobble" cards in a classical Fano plane arrangement. However, there are many  ways to arrange the cards; the different arrangements correspond to automorphisms of the Fano plane. This group is in fact \\(\\mathrm{PGL}(3,2)\\), which happens to be isomorphic to \\(\\mathrm{PSL}(2,7)\\). This is the automorphism group of the Klein Quartic, which can be illustrated using a regular heptagon tiling of the hyperbolic plane. All the terms will be explained in the talk. A key themes is the use of groups to describe symmetries of geometric objects.

As always, pizza will be provided after the talk (suitable for all dietary requirements).

On **Friday (10th)**, we are running **Coffee and Cake**, our weekly welfare event, from **1600** to **1700**, in **MS.04**. Drop in to get a hot drink and some food, and relax with others in an informal and friendly environment.
