Applications for this academic year’s *Undergraduate Research Support Scheme* (*URSS*) will open in November, only a few short weeks away.

The Undergraduate Research Support Scheme enables Warwick undergraduate students to carry out a non-assessed, self-directed research project. The project should be between 6-10 weeks, and you will receive supervision from a Warwick academic. URSS projects are usually carried out over the summer between July and September.

You can do the research in a different department from your home department, and the research topic does not have to be related to your degree course.

You can apply for a bursary of up to £1500 to contribute to your living expenses and other associated costs whilst carrying out your project. You can carry out your project on campus, at home, or, if you are interested in travelling abroad, you can carry out your project outside of the UK. Campus accommodation is available over the summer. For further details about campus accommodation, see [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/reception/faq/section_5).

The scheme is open to all undergraduate students in all faculties, including first and final year students. Unfortunately, the scheme is not open to exchange students.

If you’re interested in applying to this scheme, it’s a good idea to get thinking about the kind of research you would like to do soon, and even begin talking to some potential academic supervisors.

The 2024 **URSS Showcase** will take place in the **Panorama Room, Rootes Building**, on **Wednesday (13th)**, **1300-1600**. You’re welcome to come along, see the posters produced by this year’s participants, stay for the research presentations, and talk to staff and students about the experience of taking part in URSS. You can also explore the online URSS Showcase here.
