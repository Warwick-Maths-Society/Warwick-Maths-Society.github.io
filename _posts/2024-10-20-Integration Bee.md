We are pleased to announce that we will be hosting the first round of the annual **UK University Integration Bee** on **Monday (4th)**, starting at **1800** in **MS.01**! You will be competing against your peers, as well as teams from the UK and Singapore, at universities including Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial. Just bring yourself, paper, and pen!

The first round will consist of 30 integrals to be solved over the course of 2 hours in teams of up to 3 people. Teams which attain a sufficiently high mark will be invited to compete in the second round which will be held in Oxford in mid February.

More information -- including syllabus and past papers -- can be found [here](https://integration.soc.srcf.net/).

Please confirm your place by completing [this form](https://forms.gle/doeMakJS2P4FnVhV9). If you already have decided on a team, then only one person from your team needs to complete the form.
