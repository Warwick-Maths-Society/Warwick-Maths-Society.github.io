Abstract:
> A Turán \\((s,r)\\)-system is an \\(r\\)-graph \\(G\\) in which every set of \\(s\\) vertices contains at least one edge, and the Turán density \\(t(s,r)\\) is the asymptotically smallest edge density of such \\(G\\). The question of estimating this function received a lot of attention since it was first raised by Turán in 1941. I will give an overview of this area, including some new upper bounds on \\(t(s,r)\\) when \\(r\\) tends to infinity.
