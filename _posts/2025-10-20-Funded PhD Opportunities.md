Two funded PhD positions, supervised by [Thomas Forster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Forster_(mathematician)) and based in Wellington NZ are available. The broad area is in set theory and model theory, and in particular, the New Foundations system. For a list of possible thesis topics, see [this page](https://thomasedwardforster.github.io/thesistopics.pdf).
