In preparation(?) for the [Integration Bee]({% post_url 2024-10-20-Integration Bee %}) running on the 4th (see link for more details), we are running the highly anticipated **Drunk Integration Bee** this **Friday (25th)**, in **MS.03** starting from **1900**. Drop in and see whether there is an inverse relationship between integrability and intoxication!

Despite the name, drinking not required -- please still drop in if you have a desire to do late night maths!

On **Friday (18th)**, we are running **Coffee and Cake**, our weekly welfare event, from **1100** to **1200**, in **MB0.07** (bottom floor of MSB). Drop in to get a hot drink and some food, and relax with others in an informal and friendly environment.
