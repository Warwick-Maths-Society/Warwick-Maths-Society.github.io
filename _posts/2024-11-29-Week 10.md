### Regular Events Schedule

---

On **Wednesday (4th)**, we will be running **Maths Caf√©** in the **UG Workroom** as always, from **1300** to **1500**. As usual, we will be bringing some food for you to enjoy.

If you have any academic questions, our academic support officers (and many other attendees) will be happy to help. Also feel free to ask any questions about LaTeX.

---

Also on **Wednesday (4th)**, the **Introduction to Tikz/PGF LaTeX Course** will be running in **A0.05**, from **1600** to **1800**. This course is aimed at second years and onwards who may need to use Tikz/PGF in essays and research projects.

This course will not cover setting up a LaTeX environment and will assume a reasonable amount of familiarity with LaTeX. Having a local LaTeX installation for this introduction is recommended, but not required.

---

On **Thursday (5th)**, we are running **Coffee and Cake**, our weekly welfare event, from **1100** to **1200**, in **MB0.08**. Drop in to get a hot drink and some food (including some Christmas-themed snacks and cakes!), and relax with others in an informal and friendly environment.

---

Also on **Thursday (5th)**, we have our regularly scheduled **WMS Talk** titled *On the Embeddedness of Minimal Surfaces*, with student speaker Aris Mercier (one of WMS's Academic Support Officers), in **MS.04**, starting at **1800**. Pizza (suitable for all dietary requirements) will be provided at the end for all attendees.

Abstract:
> Roughly speaking, a minimal surface is one that locally minimises its surface area among all surfaces which share a common boundary. These surfaces are of great importance in mathematics and physics, with their study forming an active area of research. The talk begins with a gentle introduction to geometric measure theory. We then demonstrate that under certain conditions on their boundary, minimal surfaces must be smoothly embedded, and conclude by establishing links to a famous theorem of Milnor in topology

---

Also on **Thursday (5th)**, we have our **Annual Christmas Party: The Integrating Factor**, in the **Maths UG Workroom** from **1900** to **2200**. Come along to unwind, celebrate the festive season and enjoy some free alcohol and pizza.

For **first year undergraduate students**, our Academic Support Officers, Aris and Kit, will be running an **MA141 Analysis 1 revision lecture** on **Friday (6th)** from **1800** to **1900** to help you prepare for your Analysis 1 exam in January. Come along with questions, or fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/oLWrqw633XrxVkEc8) ahead of time to suggest topics you'd like to see covered.
