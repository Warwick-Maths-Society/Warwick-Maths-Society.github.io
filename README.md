## Previewing Changes

If you would like to preview your changes locally, you will need to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) in order to build your site locally.

1. [Install Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
   * Run `ridk install` on the last step of the installer and choose `MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain` when prompted.
   * Alternatively, you can use WinGet:

     ```
     
     if you already have a package manager.
3. [Install RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download).

### VSCode Setup

<details>

> ⚠️ When editing your post/review/other page contribution, make sure that you are editing a `.md` source file, and not an `.html` file generated by Jekyll.



## Module Reviews

The module review page may be found [here](_pages/module_reviews.md).

Each module review will look something like this:

```html
<!-- -->
<div class="card-header" id="headingMAXYZ">
  <h2 class="m-0">
    <button class="btn btn-link btn-block text-left" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseMAXYZ" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseMAXYZ" id="MAXYZ"
    disabled>
      <large><a href="#MAXYZ">MAXYZ Module Name</a></large>
    </button>
  </h2>
</div>
<div id="collapseMAXYZ" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingMAXYZ" data-parent="#accordionY3maths">
  <div class="card-body">
    <large class="text-muted">YY/YY</large>
    <br/>
    review here
  </div>
</div>
<!-- -->
```

with empty comment lines marking the boundaries of each review.

#### If a review does not already exist:
1. Replace the `review here` line with the review. See existing reviews for formatting conventions.
2. Delete the `disabled` attribute from the button (which is helpfully written on a separate line).

> ⚠️ Do not remove the closing angle bracket (`>`); just move this to the end of the line above to keep things neat.

#### If a review already exists:
1. Add two new lines (`<br/>`) **above** the year line of the **highest** older review at the top of the list.
2. Stack the new review on top (including adding a copy of the year line), formatting the new review as usual.

That is:

```html
<div id="collapseMAXYZ" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingMAXYZ" data-parent="#accordionY3maths">
  <div class="card-body">
    <large class="text-muted">22/23</large>
    <br/>
    This is my old review. It is old.
  </div>
</div>
```
should turn into:

```html
<div id="collapseMAXYZ" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingMAXYZ" data-parent="#accordionY3maths">
  <div class="card-body">
    <large class="text-muted">23/24</large>
    <br/>
    This is my new review. It is new.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <large class="text-muted">22/23</large>
    <br/>
    This is my old review. It is old.
  </div>
</div>
```



## Book Reviews/Recommendations

The main book review page may be found [here](_pages/book-reviews.md). The classification subpages may be found [here](_pages/book-reviews).

Each book review will look something like this:

```html
<p class="line-height: 10%">
    <strong>Book Title</strong> <!-- Book title -->
    <br/>
    <span class="text-muted">John Smith, Sarah Jones</span> <!-- Author -->
    <!-- <a href="">Online link</a> --> <!-- Uncomment if online copy is available -->
    <br/>
    <span class="text-muted"><i>Prerequisites:</i></span>
</p>

Review here.
```

1. Copy this template to the appropriate file and fill in the review.

2. If reviews already exist, separate the new review from existing ones using a horizontal rule (three hyphens alone on a line, with blank lines above and below). That is,
  
   ```html
   <p class="line-height: 10%">
       <strong>The Iliad</strong>
       <br/>
       <span class="text-muted">Homer, Samuel Butler</span>
       <a href="https://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.html">Online link</a>
       <br/>
       <span class="text-muted"><i>Prerequisites: Some knowledge of ancient Greek literature.</i></span>
   </p>
   
   Homer's Iliad centers on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles during the last year of the Trojan War.
   ```
   should turn into:
   ```html
   <p class="line-height: 10%">
       <strong>The Iliad</strong>
       <br/>
       <span class="text-muted">Homer, Samuel Butler</span>
       <a href="https://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.html">Online link</a>
       <br/>
       <span class="text-muted"><i>Prerequisites: Some knowledge of ancient Greek literature.</i></span>
   </p>
   
   Homer's Iliad centers on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles during the last year of the Trojan War.

   ---
 
   <p class="line-height: 10%">
       <strong>The Odyssey</strong> <!-- Book title -->
       <br/>
       <span class="text-muted">Homer</span> <!-- Author -->
       <a href="https://classics.mit.edu/Homer/odyssey.html">Online link</a>
       <br/>
       <span class="text-muted"><i>Prerequisites: A first course on classical antiquity and the Hellenistic period.</i></span>
   </p>
   
   The Odyssey begins after the end of the ten-year Trojan War, from which Odysseus, king of Ithaca, has still not returned because he angered Poseidon, the god of the sea.
   ```



## Essay Contributions

To contribute your essay

1. Rename your essay file in the following format:

   ```shell
   [mark] - [full essay name].pdf
   ```

> ⚠️ Your file must be a PDF.

2. Copy it into [`assets/essays-2`](assets/essays-2) or [`assets/essays-3`](assets/essays-3), depending on whether it is a second or third year essay.

3. Navigate to the [essay page](_pages/essays.md).

4. In the appropriate table, add the following lines:

   ```html
   <tr>
     <td>[mark]</td>
     <td><a target="_blank" href="./assets/essays-[2|3]/[mark] - [full essay name].pdf">[full essay name]</a></td>
   </tr>
   ```

   replacing each field as required.



## Posts

> ℹ️ This section should only be relevant to Exec or other authorised persons; pull requests for unauthorised posts will be closed without discussion.

The template for new posts (`YYYY-MM-DD-template.md`) can be found [here](_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-template.md), and quick reference sheets for markdown/kramdown can be found [here](_cheatsheet) (or [live](https://warwick-maths-society.github.io/cheatsheets)). New posts should be placed in the [_posts](_posts) directory (i.e. the same folder as the post template).

Rename your copy of the template post in the following format `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md`, and see the included instructions for more details.

Place any files that need to be hosted on the site itself in the `assets` directory, preferably in a sensibly named subdirectory.

> ⚠️ Look to future-proofing your file naming/storage system; if it is likely that similar files will be continue to be uploaded for several years (i.e. talk slides), then consider adding a subsubdirectory indicating the year, or otherwise organising your file(s) in a sensible way.

To access your files in a post, you can use `../` to go up a level in a relative path (which you will need to do, as posts are in a separate directory). You must also wrap any paths/file names that include spaces with angle brackets:

```md
... to see my awesome file, click [here](<../assets/myfiles/my file name with spaces.pdf>).
```

To link to a *post*, or other content generated by Jekyll, use the the following [liquid tag](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#linking-to-posts):

```html
... see our other post, [here]({% post_url 2024-01-01-post name %}).
```
> ⚠️ Remember to remove the `.md` file extension.

Please also tag your posts with some or all of the following:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tag | \<year\>    |`events`                        | `updates`             | `talks`      | `sport` |
| For | all posts   | socials, circles, competitions | elections, ball, WIMP | weekly talks | sport   |
