One of the most famous introductions to the subject, and the main reference for the three algebraic topology modules at Warwick (*MA3F1 Introduction to Topology*, *MA3H6 Algebraic Topology*, and *MA4J7 Cohomology and Poincar√© Duality*). The book often relies on geometric or visual intuition in proofs which may be helpful conceptually for a first course, but can feel rather informal or otherwise difficult to generalise in many cases, particularly low-dimensional arguments. The book does not cover any differential topology.
