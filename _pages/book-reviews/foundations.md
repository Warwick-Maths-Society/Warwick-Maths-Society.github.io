    <span class="text-muted"><i>Prerequisites: Category theory, set theory, type theory.</i></span>
</p>

A short preprint, exploring the links between set theory, type theory, and category theory. A must-read for anyone interested in the topic.

    <strong>Topoi: The Categorial Analysis of Logic</strong>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <span class="text-muted"><i>Prerequisites: None.</i></span>
</p>

This text is a comprehensive introduction to category and topos theory in the context of logic. While technically all category theory required is covered in this text, I would still recommend learning some category theory elsewhere first, as the ordering/pacing of the material is somewhat dubious. For instance, the Yoneda lemma is one of the first results covered in most category theory texts, but is -- for some reason -- deferred to the final chapter here, making many of the proofs throughout the book extremely difficult to follow for little reason. The typesetting in the book is also noticably outdated, as the book is relatively old, predating the common usage of TeX.

    <strong>A Simple Introduction to Computable Analysis</strong>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <span class="text-muted"><i>Prerequisites: Basic real analysis, point-set topology, and complexity theory; a first course on computability theory.</i></span>
</p>

This short book introduces the fundamentals of computable analysis of the real numbers. An interesting read for logicians and computer scientists that enjoy analytical flavours of mathematics.
