        This is a 100% coursework coding introductory Java course, with a maths module code but taught by the DCS. The module assessment consists of three programming assignments, worth 25%, 35% and 40% of the module mark respectively -- these assignments are harder than anything in MA124 Maths by Computer, but are very doable if you put in the time and don't leave them until the night before they are due! The assignments are mainly focused on using Java to solve computational maths problems, rather than programming in Java for its own sake.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        For anyone who has already coded in Java (or has any significant programming experience) I would absolutely recommend this module more than any other first year optional: its 100% coursework nature means that it is very possible to get almost all, if not full, marks and it is one less exam to worry about in the summer.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Second years can also take this module, so if you are confident in Java you might want to save it for then to increase the degree credit you get from it (as second year is worth more than first). I'd still recommend it to anyone who hasn't done much programming but enjoyed MA124 in term 1, provided you are prepared to put in the time to learn Java and do the assignments alongside your other modules. The lectures for this module are entirely online and have PowerPoints that you can read through too, there are also in-person drop in labs run by TAs too -- personally I found the latter a lot more helpful, but both are potentially useful resources. In the end though, like maths, coding is not a spectator sport -- you'll get the most out of this module by putting in the time and trying the assignments!

        This module is split into two parts: the first half covers the basics of enumerative combinatorics, up to and including a short section on generating functions; and the second half covers some basic extremal graph theory, mostly on vertex and edge colourings and Kuratowski's theorem on minimal forbidden subgraphs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In the first half, we learn about bijective proof techniques, using them to count the classical problem of placing balls into boxes (or counting functions between two discrete sets, or other equivalent formulations) up to various symmetries, which leads into integer partitions, Stirling numbers of the second kind, Catalan numbers, and a brief introduction to generating functions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The second half of the module pairs well with <i>CS137 Discrete Maths 2</i>, <i>CS254 Algorithmic Graph Theory</i>, and to a lesser extent, with <i>MA252 Combinatorial Optimisation</i>, but serves well as a first course on graph theory alone. Graph traversal problems (Eulerian/Hamiltonian graphs) are introduced, followed by graph packing problems (independent sets, matchings, etc.), before covering some chromatic problems. The very last portion of the module covers some Ramsey theory and introduces some probabilistic proofs, similar to those from <i>CS137 Discrete Maths 2</i>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The notes are well written and readable, though somewhat slow-paced, and the lecturer is also engaging and responsive throughout the course. The assignments and exam questions are also all interesting and require some amount of thought and creativity rather than mechanically applying rules and theorems.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Overall, the module is certainly on the easier side, and a high grade can be expected without too much hassle. Getting to grips with combinatorial thinking and theorems, as well as graph theory, is also greatly important, particularly in algebra, topology, geometry, and probability theory, as many results in these areas are combinatorial in nature. The main focus of this module is on enumerative combinatorics, but the second half of the module introduces some existential or extremal combinatorics as well, and you will find that these ideas pop up more and more as you progress through other modules.

        The first half of this module is occupied with an introduction to asymptotic notation and Landau symbols, with some basic algorithm analysis, up to and including the Master theorem for recursive algorithms. Next, graphs are introduced, and we explore algorithms for solving various classic graph theory problems, such as graph traversals, minimum spanning trees, and shortest path. Networks and flows are then introduced, leading up to the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the max-cut min-flow theorem, and flow decomposition. Then, we cover the graph-theoretic version of Hall's condition/Hall's theorem and algorithms for stable matchings.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The second half of the module covers linear programming; converting linear programs to standard form, and transforming various graph optimisation problems into linear programs, before covering the geometric and tabular simplex methods.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In the year I took this module, the notes were handwritten and nigh unreadable, and the lectures were dull and unengaging; on some occasions, mistakes would be found near the end of an example, upon which the lecturer would erase the board and then repeat the last 20 minutes of the lecture with the mistake amended. The notes and lecturer have changed (improved) in the 23/24 academic year, but the content has remained largely unchanged, so the above summary is still applicable. Overall, the content in this module seems somewhat disjointed and incomplete: the only reason you should take this module would be to fill in extra MA2-coded modules for the second year MMath requirement -- because if you are interested in this kind of mathematics, there are far better module options to take.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In particular, if you are interested in algorithms and graph theory, which the bulk of this module concerns itself with, you would be better off taking <i>CS260 Algorithms</i> and <i>CS254 Algorithmic Graph Theory</i>; and if you are interested in complexity theory (NP-hardness, complexity classes, matroids, etc. which <i>used</i> to be in this module before being replaced with linear programming), then I recommend taking <i>CS301 Complexity of Algorithms</i>, or alternatively for computability theory, <i>C259 Formal Languages</i>, <i>PH345 Computability Theory</i>, and <i>PH349 Logic III: Incompleteness & Undecidability</i>.

        This optional module is a great choice for anyone who liked and did well in previous analysis modules and Modelling 1! It also goes well with the core MA260 Norms, Metrics & Topologies that takes place in the same term. There is a decent balance between proof and computation -- the module begins more proof orientated, proving results such as the contraction mapping theorem and Picard theorems (all of which are also seen at the end of MA260) and later is more computational, such as determining the stability of fixed points and drawing their phase portraits. There are also sections on Lyapunov functions, Hamiltonian systems, Lotka-Volterra equations and the Stable Manifold Theorem, which will interest those who enjoy physics and multivariable analysis.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The notes are initially dense, but are well written with lots of worked examples in the later sections. They are supported by the accompanying worksheets which are good for understanding the material -- the notes explicitly signpost to specific questions on these sheets throughout. The lectures are on the fast side but are engaging and complement the notes, the lecturer is also enthusiastic and good at answering questions both in the lectures and on forums/over email. The 23/24 exam for this module favoured computation, but this was the first year it was taught by the current lecturer so future papers might be more balanced. The content hasn't changed much under the new curriculum, so most past papers are still useful.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As someone who likes analysis and modelling, I enjoyed this module and would recommend it to anyone who found themselves asking under what circumstances we can guarantee a well-posed solution to the initial value problems from Modelling 1, as well as to those considering exploring 3rd/4th year modules in analysis, dynamical systems, physics and mathematical biology!

        This optional module continues directly on from the number theory seen in Foundations, but without the focus on cryptography and more that of a general introduction. The first half mostly recaps number theory seen in Foundations, so joint degree students who did Sets & Numbers will not be at a disadvantage. There is some non-Foundations content on quadratic residues and Legendre notation towards the end of this half. The second half is about Diophantine equations, introducing results like Minkowski's theorem and the two, three and four square theorems. There is also some overlap with Algebra 3 with Gaussian primes and unique factorisation in the Gaussian integers. The end of the module also looks at Waring's problem and results in Diophantine approximation such as the Dirichlet approximation theorem, which you may have seen in Analysis 1.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The notes are short and concise, relative to other second year modules; cover material well, and have lots of brief mentions of extension material/theorems for those who are keen to explore beyond this module. Many of the exercises seen on the worksheets and assignments are well-known 'classical' proofs and problems, so those who have read around number theory or tried olympiad number theory problems will likely have seen some of them before -- but this is far from necessary, and the questions are good practice at developing intuition, applying theorems, and spotting tricks.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The lectures were well-paced and added more detail and useful explanation as the notes were quite short. The exams for this module in 22/23 and 23/24 were nice, with a good mix of computational questions and (mostly) bookwork proofs. The content has not changed much under the curriculum changes from 23/24 onwards, so most past papers are still useful. This module is a great choice for anyone who enjoyed the number theory in Foundations and/or for anyone who has read around number theory in their own time!

        This module -- optional core for BSc (along with MA266) and (thankfully) core for MMath -- is a fantastic choice for anyone who has enjoyed previous courses in analysis, vector calculus, and partial differential equations, and is invaluable for any future analysis, modelling, or applied mathematics modules! The module begins by rehashing some material from Analysis 3 -- in particular, the definitions of continuity and differentiability in <i>n</i>-dimensions; a comparison of the directional, frechet and partial derivatives; operator norms; and dual spaces. You are then introduced to the powerful inverse and implicit function theorems, which are proved thoroughly and then are demonstrated in their use with multiple examples. The later half of the module then explores some topics previously seen in Modelling 2, but focusses on proof as well as application: the notion of the Hessian, the commutativity of partial derivatives, the second order Taylor expansion, critical point classification, integrating in higher dimensions (i.e. higher dimensional Riemann integration) and Fubini's theorem, the notion of flux, and the divergence theorem are all studied rigorously and proved. The notion of measure is also first hinted at along the way, with the idea of measure zero sets.
        <br/><br/>
        The notes are very well written and make use of a good balance of proofs and examples, and work well with the worksheets - an excellent course text recommended by the lecturer, <i> Calculus on Manifolds</i> by Spivak, also complements these well. The greatest strength of this module however is the lecturer himself, who takes a potentially very difficult subject which you would expect to be unintuitive and makes it not just seem intuitive, but also fascinating and worthy of further exploration - the lectures for this were some of the best I have attended in my 2 years here so far. The 23/24 exam for this module was a very good mix of bookwork and computation, but this was the first year this module has run in its current form, so future papers might be slightly different. While similar, the question style especially is rather different to the prior equivalent of this module, so there might not be many past papers available, but the worksheets are very good for practice. If you are a BSc student or a joint degree at all interested in potentially doing any analysis, partial differential equations, physics, or mathematical modelling that involves vector calculus in third year, it is not just recommended but essential to take this module (it is core for MMath for a reason) and I would thoroughly recommend it!

        This module, as the name suggests, focusses on two topics. Most people find the first five weeks of the module to be the hardest since at the start, asymptotics can feel a bit like educated guessing. I found that after practicing a bit, this feeling went away and it became relatively intuitive. The latter half of the module focuses on integral transforms, beginning by recapping some complex methods introduced in Analysis 3. These methods, as well as general integration techniques you should know already, are then used to apply Fourier and Laplace transforms. The second half of this module is incredibly fun since it's just messing around with different integrals and differential equations and gives a nice break to the proof based courses you take. 
        <br/><br/>
        The problem sheets and examples in the notes are great however some can be a bit tedious to work through. Since there is very little content in the module it is easy to revise and doesn't take up much time compared to other second term modules. The exams also follow a similar structure each year so it is an easy module to revise. 
        <br/><br/>
        I felt like this was one of the easiest and most enjoyable modules I took in second year and really recommend it.

        This module covers most of the languages in the Chomsky hierarchy, excluding context-sensitive languages. We begin with regular languages accepted by DFA, and prove the equivalence of languages generated by (G)NFA, regular expressions, and strictly left/right linear grammars. The Myhill-Nerode theorem and pumping lemma for regular languages is then proved, allowing us to show that some languages are non-regular.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Next, context-free languages are introduced, along with pushdown automata, parse trees, Chomsky Normal Forms, CYK parsing, and the pumping lemma for context-free languages.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In the last section, we cover Turing machines and introduce Turing-decidable and Turing-recognisable languages. The halting problem and other decidability and computability problems are then explored.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There are no official notes for this module, but the WMX notes available on this site are generally very comprehensive, and the course content has not changed in many years. The lectures are generally useful, particularly near the end of the module. Most of the problems in this module require a fair amount of creativity to solve, and are quite fun to do, and the exam also has a very consistent format.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Overall, I highly recommend this module for anyone interested in computability or complexity theory. This module also ties in well with <i>PH345 Computability Theory</i>, <i>CS260 Algorithms</i>, and <i>CS301 Complexity of Algorithms</i>.

        This module is 100% coursework, assessed as a series of short assignments followed by a longer project at the end. The module is entirely in Python and also requires very little physics background to complete, though some physics knowledge will likely help with the problem mentioned in the next paragraph.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The assignments are all relatively easy, with most of the difficulty stemming from deciphering what the question is asking; implementation is generally not too much of a problem.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There is a choice of projects at the end, but each one will be more involved than the assignments, and will likely take several cycles of debugging and troubleshooting to complete. Again, much of the time cost of the project is in deciphering the questions. A portion of the marks for the project is also allocated to parallelisation or multiprocessing (note that if you work on the project as a Jupyter notebook, you will need to write to an auxiliary .py file as multiprocessing is not supported on interactive interpreters like Juypter).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Overall, the module is on the easier side, and a high mark can likely be consistently achieved without much issue for anyone with any non-zero amount of programming experience.

        This module is a requirement if you want to do further stats modules in years 3 and 4. It begins by recapping most of the usual distributions, as well as one or two new ones I had not seen before. The second half of the module is then applying these distributions with an emphasis on likelihood methods of estimation and testing. The module is primarily focused on applying the content taught and proofs do not form a large part of the syllabus. 
        <br/><br/>
        I did not find this module enjoyable at all: the lecture notes were not very good and had few useful examples; and the problem sheets were also fairly useless in teaching the content as most were far too convoluted to be of any help when revising. The bi-weekly online assignments were reasonable, if a bit long. The best source of questions for this module are the past papers since the questions tend to be fairly similar.

        This module covers an axiomatic treatment of set theory using ZFC. After introducing some axioms, the majority of the module is spent on encoding various structures in the pure hereditary sets of ZFC, starting with pairs and relations, before constructing numbers. Some time is then spent on the notion of cardinality, finiteness, and well-ordering, as well as exploring the equivalences of various forms of Choice. Finally, cardinals and ordinals are encoded, and some basic results in cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are proved.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The notes are well-written and interesting, with lots of clearly-marked non-examinable extension material for interested readers, and the lectures complimented the notes well. The worksheets and exercises are generally relatively easy, though many of the earlier ones simply involve routine algebraic manipulations with little creativity or thought required.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The course focusses somewhat excessively on construction, and covers relatively little on set theory outside of its use in encoding other mathematical structures -- but at the same time, these constructions aren't very interesting foundationally, and <i>PH342 Philosophy of Mathematics</i> or <i>PH340 Logic III</i> would be a better pick for those interested in set-theoretic foundations. Aside from this, the module is well-taught and is suitable for students over a wide range of mathematical interests. This module is on the easier side of things, but beware that <i>MA3L1 Topics in Set Theory</i> is much more difficult and involved.

        This module is incredibly dense compared to <i>MA3F1 Introduction to Topology</i>, though it should be noted that relatively little from that module is required for this one; <i>MA3F1</i> is concerned entirely with homotopy theory, while this module covers homology theory. Only the basic notion of a homotopy, and the Seifert-van Kampen theorem are assumed in this course, and these can be learnt separately without much issue.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The module introduces the idea of homology, beginning with semi-simplicial structures and simplicial homology, before introducing the more general concept of a chain complex, and the more flexible singular homology, which is used for much of the remainder of the course. Two main results in singular homology then take up a large proportion of the middle section of the middle: proving Homotopy Invariance with chain homotopies and the prism operator; and the Mayer-Vietoris Long Exact Sequence with barycentric subdivision. Using these results, the Jordan Curve theorem is finally proved, having been mentioned since the foundations notes in first year.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The most difficult parts of the module are then covered: degrees and orientations. Some experience with manifolds and complex analysis may help in these sections. Finally, cellular homology and a proof of the equivalence of the simplicial and singular homology theories is given, along with a very brief introduction to category theory and a short epilogue on generalised (co)homology theories.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The notes are dense and often skip over many details -- in particular, many canonical maps are never explicitly given, along with other similar constructions, so some experience with category theory may help here. The lectures are very fast-paced and similarly skip over many details, leaving things as exercises or just marked as "obvious". Many interesting and beautiful results are covered in this module, but the sheer quantity and speed of content asks a lot of the students taking the module: overall, the module is difficult, but rewarding.

        This module covers a variety of topics and is very different in flavour from <i>MA241 Combinatorics</i>: this module has a much weaker focus on enumerative combinatorics, instead covering much more general theories of discrete structures -- indeed, the first half of the module is simply titled "Patterns" in the notes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We begin with finite projective planes and a surprising link to Latin squares, before moving to error-correcting codes and Shannon's coding theorem. Next, some discrete and convex geometry is covered, proving the equivalence of polyhedra and polytopes in Euclidean spaces, as well as Radon's lemma, Helly's theorem, and the Colourful Carathéodory theorem. Then, some poset and set systems are covered, where we see Sperner's theorem, Dilworth's theorem, and the Sauer-Shelah lemma.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As is traditional for a combinatorics module, the second half is occupied with graph theory. Brooks' theorem is finally proved, having been stated in various previous combinatorics/graph theory modules, and some chromatic polynomial theory is introduced. Some interesting links to algorithms are also shown in a short section on matroids that covers Rado's theorem, Horn's theorem, and the greedy matroid theorem. The last section covers some random graph theory -- in particular, some probabilistic bounds on random graphs with large chromatic number and girth, as well as exploring some limits and bounds on other graph properties like connectedness.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This module links to a variety of other modules: <i>MA243 Geometry</i> with some of the projective geometries; <i>MA3G8 Functional Analysis II</i> with convex geometry; <i>MA3H3 Set Theory</i> with posets and chains; <i>MA3K1 Mathematics of Machine Learning</i> with VC-dimension and the Sauer-Shelah lemma; and <i>MA4M8 Theory of Random Graphs</i> with the entire last section on random graphs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The notes are generally well-written, and the lecturer is enthusiastic and engaging throughout the term. The module is certainly more difficult than <i>MA241 Combinatorics</i>, but is equally as enjoyable -- if not more so -- with almost all of the problems encountered in this module requiring some creativity and thought to solve. Many of the proofs covered are also elegant and interesting to read -- in particular, the trick at the end of the polytope/polyhedra equivalence proof is not one to be skipped. The exam also involves little bookwork, and focusses much more on problem solving.
