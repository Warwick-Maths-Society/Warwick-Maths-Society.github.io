While the majority of modules at Warwick come with lecture notes, sometimes it's nice to have some additional reading material to complement the notes. (Or to entirely replace them if the lecturer decides to handwrite them illegibly.) You might also be looking for sources or learning material for essays or research projects, or just for something interesting to get in to.

To this end, we have compiled together a collection of recommendations of various reading materials for you to browse. Note that, despite the title, many of the linked texts may be interesting papers/preprints rather than full textbooks.
