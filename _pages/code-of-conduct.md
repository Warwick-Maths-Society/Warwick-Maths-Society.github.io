As a member of the Society, we will expect you to follow our Code of Conduct on all of our online platforms and at all of our Events.

Our community is built on curiosity, respect, and collaboration. These guidelines exist to make sure that everyone feels welcome and safe while participating.

1. We aim to be an open and welcoming community; please be friendly and considerate to everyone, whether they are regular attendees or newcomers.
2. We aim for all of our Events and spaces to be inclusive and accessible to all. If you encounter barriers (physical, digital, or otherwise), please let us know so we can improve.
  * Be respectful and civil at all times. This includes respecting people's identities and choice of pronouns.
  * We do not tolerate bullying or harassment of any kind. These include, but are not limited to, examples of racism, sexism, homophobia, or transphobia.
3. People of all backgrounds and stages of education are welcome. Try to be helpful to everyone asking for help on our online platforms (i.e. on Discord) and at our in-person events (i.e. at Maths Caf√©).
4. Please keep political, religious, and other often-inflammatory or volatile discussions at a minimum at our Events, unless all participants consent and the context is clearly appropriate.  
   
   We recognise that such conversations are important and may be productive, but unfortunately, they often are not. In any case, our Events are not the appropriate forum for these discussions. Private conversations are perfectly acceptable, but please do not bring up these topics to others unprompted.
5. Do not share explicit, disturbing, or distressing content on any of our online platforms.
  * Do not post unsolicited advertisements.
  * Do not post any content illegal under UK law, i.e. doxxing, pirated content, etc.

These rules should generally be common sense, so we expect that there shouldn't be any problems with following them.

These rules are enforced entirely at the discretion of the Exec running each Event or the admins on our online platforms, and any decisions made are final. If they ask you to stop doing something, stop doing it.

If you see someone behaving inappropriately on our platforms or at an Event, or have any other concerns, please get in contact with any of our Exec -- through email, private messages on social media (linked in the footer of this page), or at one of our in-person events.

Failure to comply with this Code on any of our online platforms or at any of our Events can result in expulsion from the platform, Event, or Society as a whole.

We will very rarely decide to expel someone from the Society or to bar someone from attending our Events, but in such cases, the behaviour has overwhelmingly detrimental, offensive, or malicious to the point where we believe that the offender is unlikely to meaningfully improve; thus, if you have been barred from our Events, **appeals will not be entertained**.
