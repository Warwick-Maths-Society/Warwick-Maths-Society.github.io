The mission of WMS is to serve students of all years and departments at Warwick who are interested in mathematics through its academic resources, talks, and social events. We aim to promote the communication and uses of mathematics; support mathematical education at all levels; encourage and facilitate full participation of all individuals; and foster an awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and everyday life.

# Academics

### Maths Caf√©

Every Wednesday, we run a drop-in help session in the undergraduate workroom with free snacks provided. Bring along some assignment sheets or any other mathematics that you might be struggling with, and you can seek help from our Academic Supports or other attendees.

<br/>

### Revision Guides

We have <a href="{% link _pages/module-guides.md %}">a collection</a> of condensed module notes/additional revision material. The majority of these were written by Kit L. (21/22 intake) and the curriculum has changed since they were created, so some of the older guides are slightly dated. They also have not been maintained since creation. However, they should still serve as useful revision material.

A more complete reference book (which *is* actively maintained) which may also be useful can be found <a href="https://desyncthethird.github.io/Reference.pdf">here</a>.

If you would like to contribute some notes, please get in touch with `.desync` on the WMS/WMX Discord servers.

<br/>

### Essay Archive

We have compiled <a href="/essays">a collection</a> of previous essays that you can use for reference. You can use it to see past topics covered; to gauge how difficult or accessible topics should be; how long your essay should be; or just to read at leisure to learn about some new maths from other students -- after all, (second year) essays should be accessible to other second year students.

<br/>

### Talks

We run academic talks in the department on a weekly basis, where you can learn about the research of current lecturers, PhD students, and other guest speakers.

We also help organise the Warwick Imperial Conference (WIMP), where guest speakers from Warwick and Imperial present their research.

# Socials

### Coffee and Cake

Stop by for some hot drinks and snacks at our weekly *Coffee and Cake* welfare event, run by our Equal Opportunities & Welfare officers, where you can meet other students and relax for a while.

<br/>

### Board Games Night

We run a termly *Board Games Night*, where you meet other members and hustle your new friends at board games. 

<br/>

### Circles, Bar Crawls and Pub Golf

The society runs drinking socials all through the year, with bar crawls around Leamington Spa and Coventry being favourites. A bar crawl consists of going round several bars and pubs, led by the social secretaries, and spending some time in each before moving on. Generally you have about one drink a bar, but as the night goes on, this is not always the case! A great opportunity to socialise with your coursemates and unwind after a long week of lectures.

Pub Golf is a variation on bar crawls where you split into teams and compete with other teams to finish your drinks in the least number of sips possible. There is a set drink to buy at each "hole" (bar), and there are extra challenges you can do to lower your points total. Don't worry if you don't do very well, everyone forgets about the points at the end anyway!

Circles are a traditional Warwick drinking event, held on Wednesdays from 7 normally, and sometimes other days as well, where members of the society sit in a circle with the traditional pints of purple and play drinking games with the social secretaries leading everything from the middle. The games are all quite simple, but you must remember the rules of circling: no phones out, the social secretary's word is law, and no explaining the rules of the games! You must work them out for yourself. Make sure you arrive early, there is normally a queue to get drinks, and you don't want to be late! 

As always with drinking events, the social secretaries will never force you to do something, and if you have any concerns you should speak with one of our wefare execs.

### Integration Bee

Interested in showing off your integration skills? Teams of two or three students can represent Warwick in the annual *UK University Integration Bee*. Round I takes place late in Term 1 here at Warwick, with the best teams moving on to Round II, which is typically hosted at Oxford or Cambridge in Term 2.

We also host a *Drunk Integration Bee* each year, where individual students compete against each other in an MIT-style competition. Bring your own booze!
