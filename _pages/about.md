The mission of WMS is to serve students of all years and departments at Warwick who are interested in mathematics through its academic resources, talks, and social events. We aim to promote the communication and uses of mathematics; support mathematical education at all levels; encourage and facilitate full participation of all individuals; and foster an awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and everyday life.

# Academics

### Maths Caf√©

Every Wednesday, we run a drop-in help session in the undergraduate workroom with free snacks provided. Bring along some assignment sheets or any other mathematics that you might be struggling with, and you can seek help from our Academic Supports or other attendees.

<br/>

### Revision Guides

We have <a href="{% link _pages/module-guides.md %}">a collection</a> of condensed module notes/additional revision material. The majority of these were written by Kit L. (21/22 intake) and the curriculum has changed since they were created, so some of the older guides are slightly dated. They also have not been maintained since creation. However, they should still serve as useful revision material.

A more complete reference book (which *is* actively maintained) which may also be useful can be found <a href="https://desyncthethird.github.io/Reference.pdf">here</a>.

If you would like to contribute some notes, please get in touch with `.desync` on the WMS/WMX Discord servers.

<br/>

### Essay Archive

We have compiled <a href="/essays">a collection</a> of previous essays that you can use for reference. You can use it to see past topics covered; to gauge how difficult or accessible topics should be; how long your essay should be; or just to read at leisure to learn about some new maths from other students -- after all, (second year) essays should be accessible to other second year students.

<br/>

### Talks

We run academic talks in the department on a weekly basis, where you can learn about the research of current lecturers, PhD students, and other guest speakers.

We also help organise the Warwick Imperial Conference (WIMP), where guest speakers from Warwick and Imperial present their research.

### Integration Bee

Interested in showing off your integration skills? Teams of two or three students can represent Warwick in the annual *UK University Integration Bee*. Round I takes place late in Term 1 here at Warwick, with the best teams moving on to Round II, which is typically hosted at Oxford or Cambridge in Term 2.

We also host a *Drunk Integration Bee* each year, where individual students compete against each other in an MIT-style competition. Bring your own booze!
